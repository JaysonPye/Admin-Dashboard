# Admin-Dashboard for the Odin Project's intermediate css/html.

## Please note that using grids everywhere is the point of this dashboard, so i've tried to use a variety of different methods within the grid interface.

- Taking this course to freshen up on raw html/css since i've mostly been using templating languages and  tailwind.
- It's nice to know what is being done under the hood, and it definitely for diagnosing issues with things like flexboxes and grids in the future.
